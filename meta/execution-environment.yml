# Do not delete these files even if the collection has no dependencies!
# If you delete them, ansible-builder will use bindep.txt and requirements.txt
# from the collection root by default. Especially requirements.txt in the root is often
# used for test/build/development requirements for the collection, that are
# not needed for end-users to use the collection. Ansible-builder installing these
# would increase the EE size and increase the chance of dependency collisions.
